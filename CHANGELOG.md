##Ideas - improvements after course
- styled-components restructure to regular css/scss because i don't like it!
- Learn react context api

- put the react app inside a express back-end and put it up on heroku

##LessonsLog
- how does the context work and is it better then redux?!
Redux uses the old context api of react, but it has some bennefits like debug tools and others.
In some cases Redux is still the way to go, and others it's better to use react context api.

## Questions
- how to avoid not using constructor function
- styled-components vs normal scss / css?!
